Additional notes: 
A note on timeouts:
During our testing q5 and q7 would sometimes, but not always, timeout on Chris's computer.
They would never timeout on Eric's computer. We are attributing this to Chris's machine being old and slow. Eric's computer, although boasting a slower clock speed, has far less junk on it. 
Examination of the methods involved in these questions did not reveal anything that was grossly unoptimized. 
Hopefully these timeouts will not be an issue on the grading computer.
(If they are, ask Eric for his laptop.)

A note on lateness:
On Monday, November 13, Chris and Eric went to Professor Alfeld's office and asked for an extension.
We were granted a 48 hour extension, meaning our deadline is 10PM Sunday November 19th.
This extension was documented in an email from Eric to Professor Alfeld on the 13th.
